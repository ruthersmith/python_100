"""
    Educational Gui Quiz game testing your knowledge of the us state.
    The program run by displaying a map of the us and prompting the user to start entering the name of states
    Every time the user enter the name of an actual state, it writes the name of the state on the map at the correct
    location that it gets from the accompanying 50_states.csv
    The program ends either when the users typed in all 50 states or exist the screen at which point all the states
    that were not guessed by the user would be printed to the console
