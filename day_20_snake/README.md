The goal of the game is for the user to use 
the arrow keys to move around the screen and eat 
the food that shows up in random location without
hitting the wall or touching itself

This is written using OOP Concepts and made use of
Classes, objects and inheritance

The entry point of this project is the "snake_game.py"
file.

The files:
* snake.py: is responsible for defining the Snake Class.
  The Snake is composed of a list of turtle objects
* scoreboard.py defines the Scoreboard class which extends the Turtle class.
  The Scoreboard class is responsible for any writing on the screen
  such as the score board  and "game over"
* food.py, defines the Food class
