    This program  monitors the price of a particular stock, in this case tesla
    if the price between 2 consecutive days decreases by more than 5 percent,
    the program searches the news and sends a text alert
   
   ** Note because I have a trial account with the news api, I can only get news less than a month old
    so I modified the script accordingly just to test however if you have a paid accout, you can set prod_env to true, 
    to get the news returned from the correct date [not tested] **
    
    In order to run this program, without modifying it, you can have a secret.txt file in the same directory with the 
    twilio account_sid and auth_token, news_api_key, alphavantage_api_key each in a separate line in the listed order.
