<strong>Project:</strong> Turtle Crossing Game

Fully interactive program designed to replicate 
the likes of the Crossy Road game.

Crossy Road is an arcade video game released on 20 November 2014.
It was developed and published by Hipster Whale,
with the name and concept of the game playing on the age-old joke
"Why did the chicken cross the road?" <br>
wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossy_Road

The goal of this game is to move your character,
in our case the turtle up the screen using the up arrow key
without getting hit by the rectangular blocks representing vehicles

once the turtle reaches the top of the screen, it gets reset
to the starting position, this time leveled up.

Similar to the previous snake and pong game this makes use of OOP Concepts
such as Classes, objects and inheritance, with additional features
such as data persistence by saving the highest level in a text file.
As well as error handling.
